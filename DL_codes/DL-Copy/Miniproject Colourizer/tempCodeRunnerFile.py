 Training Dataset is computationally expensive and dataset required is quite large.
#  Hence we will use Pre-trained Models.
#  Model files we used:
#  1. colorization_deploy_v2_prototxt.
#  2. pts_in_hull.npy.
#  3. colorization_release_v2.caffemodel [https://www.dropbox.com/s/dx0qvhhp5hbcx7z/colorization_release_v2.caffemodel?dl=1]
#  Place the caffe model in the colorize folder.
